# SpeedrunPad-
A simple 4 key hack pad that can be used for minecraft speedrunning. Also includes a rotary encoder to quickly change on of your settings.

I made this project cause ive recently started to get into the Minecraft speedrunning community and having a dedicated macropad for it justsounds really cool!

Here's my PCB!
